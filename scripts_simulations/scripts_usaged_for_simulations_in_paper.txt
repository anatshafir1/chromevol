The detailed scripts were used for the simulations described in the "A non-homogenous model of chromosome-number evolution to reveal shifts in the transition patterns across the phylogeny" paper.
It is assumed that the empirical datsets are already obtained as detailed in the manuscript. Parameter files that were used for inferences in the manuscript could be found in the param_file_examples directory.

Script name: defs.py
Description: 
	The script contains global definitions of variables that are used in the scripts detailed below. These global variables should be editted as specified in the defs.py file.
###########

Script name: prapare_data.py
Description: 
	Samples empirical trees and accordingly also the chromosome counts. The tree is sampled such that it contains the approximate sizes of the required
	foreground subclades.
Usage:
	prepare_data.py -t <the directory of the empirical datasets> -o <the directory where the sampled datasets will be created> -f <the required fraction sizes of the subclades> -s <the required size of the sampled tree> -q <queue>

Example of usage:
	prepare_data.py -t /path/to/the/directory/of/empirical/datasets -o /path/to/datasets/with/sampled/trees -f 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.4 -s 400 -q my_queue
Parameters:
	-t: A directory that contains the directories of the datasets (for example, Cyperaceae and Solanaceae). The directory of each dataset should contain the tree file named tree.newick and chromosome counts (counts.fasta).
	-o: A path to the directory that should contain the datasets directories with the output sampled trees and fasta files.
	-f: The required foreground clade sizes as fractions (foreground clade size/sampled tree size). The sampled tree should be created randomely, but also such that it will contain the approximate sizes of the required subclades.
	-s: The required size of the sampled tree.
	-q: The queue name required for the PBS system.

Script name: simulate_heterogeneous_models.py
Description: 
	simulate either homogeneous or heterogeneous models
Usage:
	python simulate_models.py -n <number of simulations> -t <directory that contains the tree file> -m <model> -k <factor of change> -s <subclade size> -o <directory for simulations> -r <manipulated rates> -e <results directory of one-shift model> -q <queue>
	
Example of usage:	
	python simulate_models.py -n 100 -t /path/to/sampled_trees/Cyperaceae/ -m g+L_l+L_du+E_de+C_b+C -k 4.0 -s 0.05 -o /groups/itay_mayrose/anatshafir1/phd_project/power_simulations/hetero_C_c/ -r all -q my_queue
Parameters:
	-n: number of required simulations. These number should be always higher than the actually needed number of simulations, since some of the simulations are not successful.
	-t: A directory that contains the tree on which the chromosome number evolution should be simulated.
	-m: The required model. For example: g+L_l+L_du+E_de+C_b+C. g+L= linear gain rate; l+L= linear loss rate; du+E= exponential duplication rate; de+C= constant demi-duplication rate; b+C = constant base number rate.
	-k: The factor by which the rates of the subclade should be multiplied. If k is set to 1, a homogeneous model is simulated.
	-s: The required ratio between foreground subclade size and the total size of the tree.
	-o: The directory where all the simulations should be created.
	-r: The manipulated rates. 'all' means that all the transition type rates are multiplied by the factor specified by the k parameter. Other options are currently not available.
	-e: if -k is set to 0 and -e is specified (i.e., is not set to the default value None), than instead of using multiplied rates, the simulation is based on the maximum
		likelihood parameters inferred by the optimized model with one shift. In such case, -e specifies the directory path to the respective ChromoEvol results files.
	-q: The queue name required for the PBS system.

Script name: utils.py
Description: 
	Contains auxilary functions for all the other scripts.
#######

Script name: test_simulations_success.py
Description: 
	Deletes unsuccessful simulations, an re-orders the simulations numbering.
Usage: 
	python test_simulations_success.py -n <number of required simulations> -i <initial number of simulations> -d <path to the created simulations directories> -o <path to max reach chromosome count statistics>
Usage example:
	python test_simulations_success.py -n 50 -i 100 -d /path/to/simulations/0.2/0.5/all -o /path/to/statistic/file/max/state/stats.csv
Parameters:
	-n: The required number of simulations, that should remain.
	-i: The initial number of simulations.
	-d: a directory that contains the directores that refer to the simulated datasets (specified as 0,.., <intial number of simulations-1>).
	-o: A file that details the statistics regarding the max reached chromosome counts in the leaves or during on anywhere else in the evolutionary path.
#######
	
Script name: create_job_files.py
Description: 
	Contains the format of the job file (PBS format).
